Im using TexStudio as editor and all macros and scripts do work in my setup. These might need some packages and other configuration done to work but as I dont have that information written anywhere I cant write instruction to that. 

But if I dont remember incorrectly you need to define atleast External terminal comman in the editors configuration as C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe
